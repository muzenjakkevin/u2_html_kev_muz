              Lamborghini has never shied away from challenges, which is precisely why it created the new Aventador SVJ. To combine cutting-edge technology with extraordinary design, without ever coming to compromises.
              In a future driven by technology, it’s easy to lose track of emotions. But in the future we are shaping, real emotions won’t be left behind. Because at the wheel, there will always be a person.

              The vehicle has been re-engineered in its entirety, as regards its weight, engine power, chassis and above all by introducing an innovative system of active aerodynamics: ALA.
              The use of the awarded Forged Composites®, a shapable forged carbon fiber material patented by Automobili Lamborghini, is a real nice touch and it contributes to make the vehicle even lighter in weight.
              Besides its extraordinary technological properties, it also conveys a new idea of beauty.</p>
